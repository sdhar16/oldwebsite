## My own News Aggregator
This is my news aggregator site. It aggregates News data from: 
1. The Hindu for Delhi and Indian news
2. CNN for International and Technological news

I did not like any existing new aggregators so I made one which only uses the sources that I like.
I implemented this using various RSS feeds that are provided with the news site. I also used various other APIs and scraped the content of these websites to extract images, content and headlines.
